    // Graphs:

        // a mathematical structure that represents relationships among entities in the real world
        // for convenience, we define a graph as G = (Vertices , Edges)

        // Graph Terminology:

            // Vertices: Points on the graph
            // Edges: Pathways connecting various points on a graph

            // Weighted Graphs: graphs, where different edges are given a different numerical weight
            // Directed/Undirected Graphs: graphs, where edges are set to travel in a specific direction

            // Adjacent Vertices: 2 Vertices that are connected to the same edge
            // Incident: an edge in a graph that joins 2 vertices, is incident to both vertices
            // Degree: the number of edges incident to it (number of edges touching a vertex)
            // Neighbour: Two vertices or Two edges are neighbours if they are adjacent

            // Loop: an edge that connects exclusively 1 vertex to itself
            // Parallel Edge: 2 Vertices that are connected by 2 or more edges

            // Simple Graph: graph that doesnt have loops or parallel edges
            // Complete Graph: Every Vertex connects to every other vertex
            // SubGraph: A graph that contains all the vertices of the graph (not necessarily all the edges)
            // Spanning Tree: A subgraph, that contains the minimum amount of edges required to connect everything
