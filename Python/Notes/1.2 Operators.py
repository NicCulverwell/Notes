""" Arithmetic Operators

Negation (-)
    Changes the Sign of values/variables

Addition (+)
    Adds two valaues/variables

Subtraction (-)
    Subtracts two values/variables

Multiplication (*)
    Multiplies two values/variables

Division (/)
    Divides two values/variables

Truncating Division (//)
    Divides two values/variables 
    Drops any remainder

Modulus (%)
    Divides two values/variables
    Only stores the remainder

Exponentiation (**)
    Finds the Exponential Power between two values/variables

Also Known as Comparison Operators


Greater Than (>)
compares two variables to determine which has the higher numerical value
    variable 1 > variable 2
        is variable 1 greater than variable 2?          ||          True?       ||          False?          ||


Less Than (<)
compares two variables to determine which has the lower numerical value
    variable 1 < variable 2
        is variable 1 less than variable 2?          ||          True?       ||          False?          ||


Equal to (==)
compares two variables to determine if the two variables are equal to each other
    variable 1 == variable 2
        is variable 1 equal to variable 2?          ||          True?       ||          False?          ||


Not Equal to (!=)
compares two variables to determine if the two variables are not equal to each other
    variable 1 != variable 2
        is variable 1 not equal to variable 2?          ||          True?       ||          False?          ||


Greater Than or Equal(>=)
compares two variables to determine which has the same or higher numerical value
    variable 1 >= variable 2
        is variable 1 greater than or equal to variable 2?          ||          True?       ||          False?          ||


Less Than or Equal(<=)
compares two variables to determine which has the same or lower numerical value
    variable 1 <= variable 2
        is variable 1 less than or equal to variable 2?          ||          True?       ||          False?          ||

""" Logical Operators
Perform Logical Operations on Boolean Literals or Variables:

Not Operator
Flips a single boolean literal or variable to the opposite value
    variable 1 = True
    not variable 1 = False

And Operator
    Results in True if both variables compared are true
    False otherwise

    x = true and y = true == true
    x = true and y = false == false
    x = false and y = false == false
    x = false and y = false == false

Or Operator
    Results in True if at least one of the variables compared are true
    False otherwise

    x = true and y = true == true
    x = true and y = false == true
    x = false and y = false == true
    x = false and y = false == false
