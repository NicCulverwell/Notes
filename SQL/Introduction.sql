-- SQL Basics --

-- the LIGHTNING ICON ABOVE SQL BASICS:
	-- will run every line of code within this Query
    -- NOTE that each line run, will remain true, until countered
		-- if you create a DATABASE, you must close it before you run the code fully again, else you will get an error for creating it twice
        -- the LIGHTNING ICON with Typing Cursor will run esclusively 1 Line, using this you can turn your databse on or off, open or close TABLES, view DATA etc. without running the whole database

CREATE DATABASE store;		-- makes a new database called store [only can be created once]
USE store;					-- runs store [essentially imports the store database]


SHOW DATABASES;				-- shows the user what databases the RootConnection has access too

-- DROP DATABASE store;			-- deletes the database
